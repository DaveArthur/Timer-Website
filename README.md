# Timer-Website
Full screen minutes and seconds timer in JavaScript

Added to Github in order to have simple mistakes fixed, but all possible improvements are welcomed.
The program is very basic and should be easy to fix, 
I just can't find the problem as JavaScrip is not my strong point.

The timer, set to 00:00 in the HTML, is not changed (it is the only part that can) when the JavaScript is run and 
therefore the program is obsolete.

Thanks for the help,
Jack
